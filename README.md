**THE PROBLEM**

While mental health awareness and mental illness have become increasingly large topics over the past few years, their effects have been further exacerbated during and following the COVID-19 pandemic. And, it is teenagers who are most affected by mental health related issues. Reportedly, 20% of adolescents struggle with mental illness (CDC), that’s 1 in 5 teenagers. With this, teens are in need of resources to help with their mental wellness.

**OUR PRODUCT**

Our app, Lotus, is focused on improving overall teen health. Through various features, including recipes, guided meditation, sleep tracking and more, teens are able to view a myriad of their own health related statistics all on one platform; individuals would typically require the use of multiple different apps to acquire each of our features.

**DESCRIPTION**

Lotus is an app targeting the health needs of teens. The app is user friendly, allowing for easy navigation through the many provided resources. 

The app consists of four main pages: home, sleep, mood, and nutrition. Each of these pages contains a multitude of resources and activities related to the subject. These resources include hotlines, recipes, breathing and meditation exercises, as well as various tips. 

When the app is opened, the user is immediately greeted with a quote or words of affirmation. This page also hosts the users customized to-do list. There are also two buttons. The first is an info button, where you can find resources and the second is a help button for directions on how to use the app.

Next, we have the sleep page. The sleep page holds a sleep tracker to monitor daily bedtime, wake up time, and the total quantity of sleep. The user can enter bedtimes and wake up times, which feeds into a graph displaying sleep statistics.

The nutrition page offers users a variety of recipes. This page provides options for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snack foods. Users can press on a subpage and scroll through a list of recipes, which include estimated preparation time. Users may also use the search bar to search for specific meals. Once a recipe is selected, it will open in the user’s web browser.

The journal function provides space within the app for users to write down thoughts, emotions, and reflections each day. The collection of journal entries may then be returned to at a later time. 

The reward system allows users to earn points for every recipe, video, or activity interacted with. This reward system encourages users to be more consistent with their app activity, thus further improving the effectiveness of the app and their overall wellness. At every point milestone (10, 25, 50, 75, 100), the user can unlock a reward. 

Finally, Our notification feature sends reminders and different affirmations throughout the day. With this, users are encouraged to consistently log into the app and utilize various functions. This feature is optional based upon user preference.
